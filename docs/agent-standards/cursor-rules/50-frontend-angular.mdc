## Structure

- Place new files by matching existing feature/module structure; check similar features first.
- Follow existing project structure and patterns; do not introduce new conventions lightly.
- Prefer explicit inputs/outputs and clear component boundaries.

## Quality

- **Fix linting issues promptly**; do not leave the repo in a lint-broken state.
- Avoid brittle selectors in UI tests; prefer stable test identifiers where needed.
