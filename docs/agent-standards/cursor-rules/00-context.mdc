# Project Context: Gravitee Access Management (AM)

> This rule is the source of truth for Cursor agent behaviour. Templates and commands are supporting references.

## Workspace Structure

This workspace contains:
- **Backend:** Java with RxJava + Vert.x patterns; layered architecture **Repository → Service → Resource**
- **Frontend:** Angular/TypeScript (`gravitee-am-ui`)
- **Tests:** unit + integration/contract tests; E2E when applicable

## Conventions

- Use **UK English** for comments, logs, and user-facing text.
- Prefer existing patterns over inventing new ones; **search for similar implementations first**.
- Keep changes small and reviewable; avoid unrelated refactors/reformatting.
- Treat `@docs/agent-standards/commands.md` as the **canonical reference** for build/test/validation commands.
- Templates under `@docs/agent-standards/templates/` are **guidance only**:
  - use them to structure plans and self-checks
  - do not create new documentation/guideline files (*.md, README, etc.) unless explicitly requested
  - freely create/modify code files as needed for implementation

## Cross-Agent Consistency

When multiple agents or iterations work on the same area, converge on a single agreed approach and avoid introducing competing patterns or parallel abstractions.
