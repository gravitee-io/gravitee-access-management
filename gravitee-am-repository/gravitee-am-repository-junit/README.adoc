= Test repositories

This module contains in-memory implementations of repositories to be used in AM's unit tests.
The goal is to have for each repository a working implementation that does not require using an actual database.

This is not a plugin; don't attempt to use it for any production code.
To use in a modules' test, add it as a test dependency:

[source,xml]

    <groupId>io.gravitee.am.repository</groupId>
    <artifactId>gravitee-am-repository-junit</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
