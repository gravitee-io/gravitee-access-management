= Cypress Integration Tests

Open a terminal in the `gravitee-am-cypress` directory.

==== Build

Execute `npm install`. You usually only need to do this once, i.e. after cloning the AM repo or when dependencies have changed.

==== Run tests with default config

Execute `npm test`. This will open Cypress in a dedicated browser window, from where you can run every test or individual tests.

==== Run tests against development environment

Execute `npm run am-dev`. Be sure to set the `cypress/config/development.json` environment file to match your own local AM settings.

==== Run against docker

Execute `npm run am-docker`.

==== Run against production

Execute `npm run am-prod`.
