= Gravitee.io Access Management - CIBA Delegated Service

== Overview

This module contains a mock implementation of a delegated service used by CIBA flow.
This service expose following endpoints:

* `/ciba/domains` to declare domain's callback
* `/ciba/notify` to request a notification (this implementation use WebSocket to notify users)
* `/ciba/notify/accept-all` to bypass the end user notification but hit the domain callback to accept the request
* `/ciba/notify/reject-all` to bypass the end user notification but hit the domain callback to reject the request

To register a domain, you have to call the `/ciba/domains` endpoint with a JSON object

```
{
    "domainId": "{{domain}}",
    "domainCallback" : "{{gateway_url}}/{{domainHrid}}/ciba/authenticate/callback",
    "clientId": "{{cibaClientId}}",
    "clientSecret": "{{cibaClientSecret}}"
}
```
