        <p>Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html">CIBA</a>) is a new authentication flow in which  Relying Parties (RP), 
          that can obtain a valid identifier for the user they want to authenticate, 
          will be able to initiate an interaction flow to authenticate their users without having end-user interaction from the consumption device. 
          The flow involves direct communication from the Client to the OpenID Provider without redirect through the user's browser (consumption device)</p>
