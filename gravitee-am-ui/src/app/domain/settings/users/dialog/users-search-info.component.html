    <h5>Information</h5>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <small>
      When searching for users, you can create queries using SCIM 2.0 query syntax to refine your search (advanced search option). The
      search query must contain at least one valid expression with an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and an optional
      value. Multiple expressions may be combined using the logical operators ("and" / "or"). Operators "[", "]" and "not" are not
      supported.

    <h5>Operators</h5>
