## Reporting a Vulnerability

Gravitee consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.
If you discover a serious vulnerability with a realistic and tested risk assessment we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.
We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems and submit:

Critical risk vulnerabilities which could result in non-trivial data loss for Gravitee or our customers:

* Bugs which could lead to sensitive massive/complete data leakage
* Bugs leading to remote code execution
* Bugs which can lead to private keys leakage or other cryptographic flaws

High risk vulnerabilities that we would consider to be High risk would include:
 
* Permanent subdomain takeover
* XSS or CSRF resulting in significant security or privacy impact to customers
* Ability to view, modify, or delete sensitive data in misconfigured on data repository
* Authentication/Authorisation issues that allow bypass the security settings
* Security misconfigurations that result in data leakage or system compromise
* Bugs allowing unauthorised operations on user accounts, with a low amount of effort required to attack/compromise a large number users
* Website, blogs or forums with relevant discussions on how to abuse Gravitee systems

* Only after review, assessment and confirmation by the Gravitee Information Security Team a risk critical score will be determined.

Please do the following:
* E-mail your findings to **bug@graviteesource.com** using the subject "**Submission**". Encrypt your findings using our **public PGP key**:
