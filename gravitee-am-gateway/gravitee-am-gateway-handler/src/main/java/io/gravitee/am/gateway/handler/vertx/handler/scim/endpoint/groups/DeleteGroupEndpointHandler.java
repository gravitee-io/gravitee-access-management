/**
 * Clients request resource removal via DELETE.  Service providers MAY
 *    choose not to permanently delete the resource but MUST return a 404
 *    (Not Found) error code for all operations associated with the
 *    previously deleted resource.  Service providers MUST omit the
 *    resource from future query results.  In addition, the service
 *    provider SHOULD NOT consider the deleted resource in conflict
 *    calculation.  For example, if a User resource is deleted, a CREATE
 *    request for a User resource with the same userName as the previously
 *    deleted resource SHOULD NOT fail with a 409 error due to userName
 *    conflict.
 *
 * In response to a successful DELETE, the server SHALL return a
 *    successful HTTP status code 204 (No Content).
 *
