== üìù Description

This repo contains some https://github.com/google/zx[zx] scripts to execute the different release steps for AM.

It will allow you to run these pipeline on CircleCI to:
- Generate Changelog

== üõ† Requirement

To run the scripts, you need to have:

* Node.js >= 16.0.0 (configured in link:.nvmrc[.nvmrc] with v18.4.0)
* https://github.com/google/zx[zx], to install it you just have to run:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -g zx
# Check everything is ok:
zx -v
----
* A https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme[dotenv] file containing the variable `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`, which is your personal token on CircleCI:
 - Go to https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens, create a token and copy it
 - Run the following command in the `release` folder to create a `.env` file with the token:

[source,shell]
----
touch .env && echo "CIRCLECI_TOKEN=[YOUR_TOKEN]" > .env
----

* Some dependencies to run the scripts, you can install them with:
[source, shell]
----
# In the `release` folder
npm install
----

== üèÅ Usage[[Usage]]

Thanks to link:package.json[package.json], you can run those scripts as simple `npm` commands (do not forget to use `npm i` before starting).

Each of the commands needs:

* A `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` in `.env` file
* the `--version` parameter

Optional flag:

* `--dry-run`: allow to run the pipeline in dry run mode


Examples:

Run the release note in dry run:
- `npm run release_notes -- --version=3.21.0 --dry-run`

Run the release note entirely:
- `npm run release_notes -- --version=3.21.0`
