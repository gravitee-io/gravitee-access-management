= Release process

== 📝 Description

This repo contains some https://github.com/google/zx[zx] scripts to execute the different release steps for AM.

It will allow you to run these pipeline on CircleCI to:

* Launch git release and maven artifact deployment to our local artifactory
* Launch deploy maven artifact to maven central (sonatype)
* Launche the build and publish of docker images
* Launch the build and publish the RPM of AM
* Launch the helm release and publish
* Launch the changelog generation (open a PR pre-filled)

== 🛠 Requirement

To run the scripts, you need to have:

* Node.js >= 16.0.0 (configured in link:.nvmrc[.nvmrc] with v18.4.0)
* (optional) https://github.com/google/zx[zx], to install it you just have to run:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm i -g zx
# Check everything is ok:
zx -v
----

* Get your own CircleCI token to be able to trigger build
** Go to https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens, create a token and copy it. It is your personal token on CircleCI
** You can create an `.env` file with your key on `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` variable. We use https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme[dotenv] read it. The following command in the `release` folder will create a `.env` file with the token:
+
[source,shell]
----
touch .env && echo "CIRCLECI_TOKEN=[YOUR_TOKEN]" > .env
----
** Or you can just export this variable (maybe add it in your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`)
+
[source,shell]
----
export CIRCLECI_TOKEN="[YOUR_TOKEN]"
----

* The scripts need some dependencies, you can install them from the `release` folder with:
+
[source, shell]
----
npm install
----

== 🏁 Usage[[Usage]]

Thanks to link:package.json[package.json], you can run those scripts as simple `npm` commands (do not forget to use `npm i` before starting).

Each of the commands needs a `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`.

You can see help and example by running:

[source, shell]
----
npm run am-release -- help
----

Examples:

* Run the git release in dry run:
+
[source, shell]
----
npm run am-release -- --branch master --gio-version 4.3.0 --dry-run release-git
----

* Run all release step:
+

Note that the configuration of CircleCI *disallow* multiple build on the same branch (a new build cancel the previous one). It means that we have to run one step at a time.
